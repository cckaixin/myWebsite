My journey in robotics began after completing my Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering at Xi’an Jiaotong University. 

Although my initial academic background was in energy systems, I developed a deep interest in robotics and subsequently joined FASTLAB at Zhejiang University as a Research Assistant under the guidance of Fei Gao. There, I gained foundational knowledge in robotics, particularly in perception-aware planning, SLAM, and motion planning on uneven terrain. During this time, I co-authored papers that were submitted to conferences such as IROS 2023, IROS 2024, and T-MECH. This experience not only honed my research skills but also sparked my interest in developing robots with the ability to interact more intuitively with their environment—an essential capability for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

To further pursue this interest, I joined GairLab at the City University of Hong Kong under the guidance of Peng Yin, where I focused on mobile manipulation. I designed and built a mobile manipulator system inspired by Mobile ALOHA and tackled challenges such as mitigating the distribution shift between sub-tasks, which often reduces task success rates. By introducing a simple adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the robot’s position before each sub-task, we significantly improved performance. Additionally, I am currently exploring the use of foundation models as policies, leveraging their common-sense reasoning to generate actions in a zero-shot manner. This direction excites me as it holds immense potential for enabling robots to handle complex, dynamic environments with minimal human intervention.

Currently, I am a visiting student in the CLVR Lab at KAIST (Seoul) under the guidance of Professor Joseph Lim, where I focus on whole-body mobile manipulation tasks. I enjoy the peaceful life here, and the people are warm and supportive. At the time of writing this, I have only been here for about 10 days, but I look forward to updating my story as I spend more time here.
